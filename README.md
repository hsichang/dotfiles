This repo contains configuration files that I have been maintaining and using across all of my dev machines.  It's not perfect, but hopefully they are commented well enough that you can pick and choose whatever options work well for you and get you up to speed quickly.

To use, just add a '.' prefix to the name of each file and move it to your root folder.
